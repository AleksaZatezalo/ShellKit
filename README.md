ShellKit is an open-source, Python-based framework designed specifically for rapid development, testing, and automation of web application exploits. Built with the needs of security researchers, penetration testers, and CTF enthusiasts in mind, ShellKit provides a powerful set of tools focused on exploiting common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, RCE (Remote Code Execution), file inclusion, and command injection.

  - Insecure Deserialization
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Command Injection
  - Prototype Pollution
  - WAF Bypass Techniques

### Advanced Tools
* **Shell Generation & Management**
  - Reverse Shell Generator (Multi-language support)
